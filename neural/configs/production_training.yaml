# Production Training Configuration
# Phase 3: Bug Fixes Applied (Kernel + Drift)

training:
  epochs: 100              # Full run for convergence
  batch_size: 32           # M4 Sweet spot
  validation_freq: 1
  learning_rate: 5e-5      # Reduced from 1e-4 for stability with stronger losses

loss:
  lambda_distill: 1.0      # Keep high as primary signal
  lambda_martingale: 1.0   # INCREASED from 0.1 (was too weak)
  lambda_drift: 0.5        # NEW: Explicit drift penalty for E[h]=0
  lambda_marginal: 0.1     # Keep low
  epsilon: 1.0             # Match classical solver

logging:
  save_freq: 5             # Save checkpoint every 5 epochs
  log_freq: 20

hardware:
  device: "mps"            # Force MPS
